the following rules: a) the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online
and/or be solely based on written submissions, the specific manner shall be
chosen by the party initiating the arbitration; b) the arbitration shall not
involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually
agreed by the parties; and c) any judgment on the award rendered by the
arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.

between you and SpringSource regarding the Contribution and supersedes all
