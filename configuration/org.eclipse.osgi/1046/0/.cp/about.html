<pre><em>Copyright-Only Dedication (based on United States law) or Public Domain Certification</em>

The person or persons who have associated work with this document (the 
"Dedicator" or "Certifier") hereby either (a) certifies that, to the 
best of his knowledge, the work of authorship identified is in the public 
domain of the country from which the work is published, or (b) hereby 
dedicates whatever copyright the dedicators holds in the work of authorship 
identified below (the "Work") to the public domain. A certifier, moreover, 
dedicates any copyright interest he may have in the associated work, and 
for these purposes, is described as a "dedicator" below.

A certifier has taken reasonable steps to verify the copyright status of 
this work. Certifier recognizes that his good faith efforts may not shield 
him from liability if in fact the work certified is not in the public domain.

Dedicator makes this dedication for the benefit of the public at large and 
to the detriment of the Dedicator's heirs and successors. Dedicator intends 
this dedication to be an overt act of relinquishment in perpetuity of all 
present and future rights under copyright law, whether vested or contingent, 
in the Work. Dedicator understands that such relinquishment of all rights 
includes the relinquishment of all rights to enforce (by lawsuit or otherwise) 
those copyrights in the Work.

Dedicator recognizes that, once placed in the public domain, the Work may be 
freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, used, modified, built upon, or 
otherwise exploited by anyone for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial, 
and in any way, including by methods that have not yet been invented or 
conceived.
